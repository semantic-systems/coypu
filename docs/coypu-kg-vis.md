## Introduction
This knowledge graph visualization tool aims to help you visualize and explore knowledge graphs directly in your browser. The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to explore knowledge graphs and discover relations.

[DEMO](https://sch-28.github.io/kg-vis)

## Features
Kg-vis offers several key features that make it a powerful and effective solution for exploring and visualizing knowledge graphs:
- **Intuitive interface:** The tool provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to interact with knowledge graphs and explore the relationships between entities. You can easily navigate through the graph and view details about specific nodes.
- **Smart search:** Quickly add new nodes using the search functionality to expand your graph.
- **Filtering:** Focus on the nodes you need, and display only relevant data.
- **SPARQL support:** Directly import data with a SPARQL query or export your built graph to SPARQL for further use.
